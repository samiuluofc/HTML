<!--Every HTML element has a default display value depending on 
	what type of element it is. The default display value for 
	most elements is block or inline.-->

<!--A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes 
up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right
 as far as it can). Examples: <div>,<h1>,<p>,<form>-->

<!--An inline element does not start on a new line and 
	only takes up as much width as necessary. Examples: <span>, <a>, <img>-->

 <!--The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but both style and class are common.
When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content.-->

<!--The <span> element is often used as a container for some text.-->

<!--The HTML class attribute makes it possible to define equal styles for elements with the same class name.-->
