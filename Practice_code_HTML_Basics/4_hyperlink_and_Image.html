	A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.

	By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):
		An unvisited link is underlined and blue.
		A visited link is underlined and purple.
		An active link is underlined and red.
	You can change the default colors, by using CSS.
